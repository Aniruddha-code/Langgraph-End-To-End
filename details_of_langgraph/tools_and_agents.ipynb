By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of the typical CPU architecture, customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be used to implement operating systems (especially kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is used on computers that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\n",
      "A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n",
      "C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\n",
      "Although neither C nor its standard library provide some popular features found in other languages, it is flexible enough to support them. For example, object orientation and garbage collection are provided by external libraries GLib Object System and Boehm garbage collector, respectively.\n",

      "Llama models come in different sizes, ranging from 1 billion to 2 trillion parameters. Initially only a foundation model, starting with Llama 2, Meta AI released instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\n",
      "Model weights for the first version of Llama were only available to researchers on a case-by-case basis, under a non-commercial license. Unauthorized copies of the first model were shared via BitTorrent. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use.\n",

      "Summary: Llama Firearms, officially known as  Llama-Gabilondo y Cia SA, was a Spanish arms company founded in 1904 under the name Gabilondo and Urresti. Its headquarters were in Eibar in the Basque Country, Spain, but they also had workshops during different times in Elgoibar and Vitoria. The company manufactured  moderate-priced revolvers and  self-chambering pistols in a wide variety of models. These were popular mainly in the European and Latin American export market, as well as domestically in Spain.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mBased on the information from Wikipedia, it seems that the term \"Llama model\" can refer to different things, including a family of large language models (LLMs) released by Meta AI, an open source software library for performing inference on large language models, and a Spanish arms company that manufactured firearms. However, given the context of the question, it is likely that the question is referring to the Llama model in the context of artificial intelligence.\n",

      "The Llama model in this context refers to a family of large language models developed by Meta AI, with different sizes ranging from 1 billion to 2 trillion parameters.

It is an open-source framework built by LangChain that streamlines the creation and management of AI agent workflows. LangGraph combines large language models (LLMs) with graph-based architectures, allowing developers to map, organize, and optimize how AI agents interact and make decisions. It provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner, enabling the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic. LangGraph is suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring.'}"

    "This approach allows the AI to ask itself follow-up questions when it doesn't immediately know the answer. It performs a recursive questioning process to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable ones.\n",

    "Step 1: Receive a complex question.\n",
    "Step 2: The agent identifies sub-questions or follow-up questions.\n",
