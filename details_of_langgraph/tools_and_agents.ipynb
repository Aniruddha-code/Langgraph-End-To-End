      "Summary: C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains widely used and influential. By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of the typical CPU architecture, customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be used to implement operating systems (especially kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is used on computers that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\n",
      "A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n",
      "C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\n",
      "Although neither C nor its standard library provide some popular features found in other languages, it is flexible enough to support them. For example, object orientation and garbage collection are provided by external libraries GLib Object System and Boehm garbage collector, respectively.\n",
      "Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top four languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.\n",

[...] The National Weather Service forecast office in Elko, Nevada, said in a post on X, Sunday: \"Monsoonal moisture will surge northward into most of Northern and Central Nevada today through Wednesday, resulting in the likelihood of wetting thunderstorms each afternoon and evening. Heavy rain may result in minor flooding of recent burn scars, streams, and creeks.\"\\n\\n## What Happens Next\\n\\nThe Burning Man festival takes place from August 24 to September 1.\\n\\nGoogle Preferred Source Banner [...] The San Francisco Chronicle reported that campsites that had been erected early were damaged after a dust storm hit the desert before the festival began.\\n\\nA dust advisory issued Saturday by the NWS said that a \"wall of blowing dust\" coming off the Smoke Creek and Black Rock Desert playa areas was moving north at around 30 mph.\\n\\nThe agency warned of sudden reductions in visibility, which could be to less than a mile. It advised that travel should be delayed.',\n",
